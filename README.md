# Elementals - HTML Enrichment

## Contribution guides
In the spirit of open source software development, I always encourage community code contribution. To get start,
all your work submitted will be subject to the MIT license. If you require a change, open a pull request and make sure
to follow the coding guidelines.

## Environments in which to use Elementals
- High traffic sites which require enriched elements. Usually, websites that still need no-js support and believe in
the fact that JavaScript is there to enrich content, not to replace.
- High browser compatibility.

## Unit tests
Unit tests still have to be implemented. These are a work in progress.

## Dependencies
None.

## Questions?
If you have any questions, feel free to open a discussion on Github.
