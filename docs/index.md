# Elementals documentation

The power of Elemental components is that it can easily enrich your content without requiring janky code solutions
whenever you are in need of re-usable components. Besides, it also namespaces your components, which means that if one
does crash, it will log the error but load the rest of the components nonetheless.

We have the following guides available:

- [Getting started](getting_started.md)
- [Responsive](responsive.md)
- [Inheritance](inheritance.md)
